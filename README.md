 **Air Quality Prediction & Monitoring Dashboard**

This project is an interactive Air Quality Analysis and Prediction System built using machine learning and data visualization. It helps in understanding pollution levels across different locations and predicting future air quality based on pollutant data.

The dashboard allows users to upload datasets, visualize pollutant trends, view geospatial pollution mapping, and generate predictions using a trained Random Forest model. It also integrates AQI color indicators and time-based trends to provide a deeper understanding of atmospheric conditions.

**Why This Project Is Helpful to Society**

Air pollution is one of the most serious environmental and health concerns today. This project helps society in the following ways:

1. Public Health Awareness

People can understand the pollution level in their city and take preventive measures (mask use, avoiding outdoor activity, etc.).

2. Early Warning & Alerts

The dashboard indicates harmful pollution levels using AQI colors.
This helps communities prepare for “Unhealthy” or “Hazardous” air days.

3. Government & Policy Support

Decision-makers can use trends and geospatial analysis to identify:

Pollution hotspots

High-risk cities

Daily/seasonal variations

This supports better environmental policies.

4. Scientific & Educational Use

Students and researchers can learn:

How AQI is predicted

How pollutants affect the environment

How machine learning can help in climate studies

5. Forecasting Future Pollution

The ML model predicts upcoming risk levels so that authorities can respond proactively (reducing traffic, controlling emissions, etc.).
